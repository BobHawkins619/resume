<h1>My Experience with git and github</h1>
<h3>Learning the basics</h3>
<p> I began by familiarizing myself with the fundamental concepts of Git, such as repositories, branches, commits, and merges. Through online tutorials and documentation, I grasped the core principles of distributed version control and understood the importance of maintaining a clean and organized commit history.</p>
<h3>Setting up git and github</h3>
<p>I installed Git on my local machine and created a GitHub account. I configured Git with my name and email address to accurately identify my contributions to the projects. I also generated an SSH key to securely authenticate and interact with remote repositories on GitHub.</p>
<h3>Creating repositories</h3>
<p>To practice using Git and GitHub, I started by creating a new repository on GitHub. I then used the Git command-line interface to clone the repository to my local machine, enabling me to work on the project locally.</p>
<h3>Making commits</h3>
<p>As I made modifications to the project files, I staged and committed my changes using descriptive commit messages. I learned the importance of writing clear and concise messages that provide meaningful context about the changes made.</p>
<h3>Resolving conflicts</h3>
<p>I encountered conflicts when merging branches with conflicting changes. I learned to resolve these conflicts by carefully examining the conflicting files, manually editing them, and recommitting the changes.</p>
